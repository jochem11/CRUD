            <h2>False CRUDAirlines messages</h2><br>
            <p>Did you receive an email about a flight that you did not book? Or have you received a message that reminds you of a fake email? This could be an attempt to obtain personal information (also known as phishing), infect your computer with a virus, or trick you into entering a fake lottery or contest. Fake emails look almost the same as real CRUDAirlines emails.</p><br>
            <p>These emails can be recognized by:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>the lack of a personal salutation;</li>
                <li>the urgent request to respond immediately;</li>
                <li>bad language and spelling mistakes;</li>
                <li>links to unknown internet addresses.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <p>CRUDAirlines will only send you 3 types of messages:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Commercial messages: In these emails you will be informed about promotions, special offers and new destinations and services of CRUDAirlines. You will only receive these messages if you have registered for them. You will never be asked to provide personal information in response to these emails. You will be redirected to the CRUDAirlines website to complete any actions.</li>
                <li>Information about your trip: When you have booked a trip, you may receive an email asking you to provide certain information that the local authorities in the country of destination need. We will also send you an email to remind you that you have yet to check in. This email will always contain information that you will recognize (such as your booking code or CRUD number). You will be redirected to the CRUDAirlines website to complete any actions.</li>
                <li>CRUDAirlines messages inviting you to participate in a CRUDAirlines survey, for example the Quality Observer. These messages always contain a link to the survey. Read more about the CRUDAirlines surveys.</li><br>

            <h2>Examples of fake emails</h2><br>
            <p>Unfortunately, many fake emails are being sent at the moment that give the impression that they were sent by CRUDAirlines. This is not the case. For example:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Mails sent by reply@blue55.squadrupee.com do not originate from CRUDAirlines and contain a contest not organized by CRUDAirlines. The links in the email point to http://blue13.squadrupee.com/ – a non-CRUDAirlines page.</li>
                <li>
                    Mails sent by advert@deltrk.com do not originate from CRUDAirlines and contain a contest not organized by CRUDAirlines. The link in the email points to http://trk.lasurk.com/ or giveaways-web.com/ which are not from CRUDAirlines.</li>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2><br>
            <p>The information, software, products and services included on this Website may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. CRUDAirlines and/or its suppliers make no representations about the suitability for any purpose of the information, software, products and services contained on this Website. All information, software, products and services are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. CRUDAirlines and/or its suppliers hereby disclaim all warranties and conditions with respect to this information, software, products and services, including all implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or title and that they not infringe.

        <div class="algemene_voorwaarden_container_valutakoersen">
            <h2>Currency rates</h2><br>
            <p>The prices on the CRUDAirlines website are expressed per country in one specific currency. The option is offered to settle and pay in a number of other currencies. This process is called Multi Currency Pricing. The conversion from the original currency to the currency in which payment is made takes place at the current mid-market exchange rate plus a fixed surcharge. This surcharge is in line with the market and CRUDAirlines strives to keep this surcharge (including the middle rate used) lower than the surcharges applied by credit card and debit card issuers such as banks. However, CRUDAirlines is not liable for differences that may arise.</p><br>
            <p>If the currency of payment is different from the currency in which your credit or debit card is charged, your card issuer will take care of the conversion. CRUDAirlines is not liable for this conversion.</p><br>
            <p>If you have chosen to pay on the CRUDAirlines website in a currency other than the original currency, your card issuer may still charge certain fees. This depends on the country and the bank. These costs are also known as 'overseas charges' or 'cross-border charges' and have nothing to do with exchange rates. These fees are also charged by the card issuers if they provide the currency conversion. This is an agreement between the card issuer and the cardholder. CRUDAirlines is therefore not liable for these costs.</p><br>
