        <h1>Welcome to CRUDAirlines</h1>
        <div class="overons_tekst">
            <p>Welcome to CRUDAirlines. Voted best online travel agency in 2000 by BBC news as the most popular online travel agency in the Netherlands from 2000 to 2022. But not only that; since 2000 we have been fighting for the lowest prices. And because of this, more than 696,969 loyal customers have already preceded you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overons_geschiedenis">
            <p>CRUDAirlines started in 1969 in Nijmegen and has grown by fully focusing on cheap holidays. In the early days, a team of employees called the travel companies or airlines we worked with every day to get the best vacation deals. And in fact we still do that, only it is now much more automated and we now work from all over the world. We have not changed in all these years; we still only want the best deals and the very, very lowest prices. And of course the best accommodations. In our offer you will find more than 10,000 spread over more than 50 countries. If you can't find a trip to your liking here, then we don't know what will.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overons_waarom">
            <h2>Why can we offer our trips so cheaply?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not have expensive stores in expensive locations where employees spend days waiting for someone to come in. The CRUDdiscounter has everything in one location and we work there 7 days a week, even in the evenings. So efficient.</li>
                <li>Everything goes through the internet and a lot of self-service. Of course you can call us if you have a question, but in principle everything can be arranged via the website. We also send everything by email, including the travel documents. Payments can be made via iDEAL and VISA (free) and American Express (extra costs). This saves costs and that is reflected in an even lower price.</li>
                <li>Stack volumes. DÃ© VakantieDiscounter has grown into the holiday discount and last minute channel in the Netherlands and we buy in bulk. We also prefer to buy more from fewer suppliers because that gives us even better prices.</li>
                <li>Not wanting to do everything. Only travel that we can really offer cheaper. So we don't do a lot. Traditionally we have spectacular prices on sun holidays to the Mediterranean and distant sun destinations.</li>
                <li>More last minutes than anyone else. Last minute holidays are often cheaper and that is why we do everything we can to excel in last minutes. Thanks to our many years of experience, we also know where to get the last/best last minutes.</li>
                <li>
                    100% independent. We have purchase contracts with almost all Dutch travel organizations. In order to be able to offer even better prices, we have also contracted the most important German travel organizations. We don't care who runs the trip, we always go for the best deal!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="overons_veiligheid">
            <p>Since 2000, all trips offered have been covered by the Stichting Garantiefonds Reisgelden (SGR: 2626). Moreover, the CRUD discounter is a member of the General Dutch Association of Travel Companies (ANVR: 3072). The CRUDdiscounter.nl is completely independent and therefore able to offer the most objective possible selection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overons_belofte">
            <p>Many sites say they are cheap, but we are. Others offer a 'discount' and then throw high booking costs on top. At the CRUDdiscounter you get the same low price and no booking or other dubious costs. All discounts, all offers. We pass on all euro discount one-on-one. That seems normal, but we know: it is not!</p>
