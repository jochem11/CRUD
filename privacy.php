                    <p>We receive your data from these parties to handle your reservations and bookings and to make your trips and purchases possible.

                    <span>(C) Personal data we receive from partners who participate in our corporate loyalty program</span>

                    <h2>4.1. The main purposes for which we use your data</h2><br>
                    <span>(A) To provide our services to you</span>
                    <p>We use the information described under 2.1 (A) to (G) to handle your reservations and bookings and to facilitate your travel and purchases. For example, we use your name, passport number and other identity information to be able to issue your ticket. We use your contact details to notify you of changes in flight status. If the persons in your booking participate in our Flying CRUD loyalty program, we use the contact details provided by them to inform them about their flight and any changes in flight status.</p><br>
                    <p>We need information about your specific medical needs to ensure that you receive the right care. We only use this information to ensure that you receive the right care.</p><br>
                    <span>(B) To run our CRUDbiz corporate loyalty program</span><br>
                    <span>(C) To provide our online services and mobile apps to you and provide a noiseless digital experience</span>
                    <p>i. For example, we use your name and flight details when you check in for your flight with our app.</p><br>
                    <p>ii. Our online services and apps sometimes use your location, for example to show you the nearest point of interest.</p><br>
                    <p>iii. In order to offer you an optimal digital experience, we analyze your digital media use. For example, we tailor our communication to the digital channel or device you use most (see 2.1 (G)).</p><br>
                    <p>iv. If you abort your booking process on our website, we will send you an email with a link to your booking process so you can continue where you left off. You will receive a similar email if you cancel the booking procedure on the website of our partners Airtrade or OptionTown, who offer package deals and flight bundles. We will only send these emails at your request or if you have agreed to receive updates and special offers by email (see 4.1(E)). You can withdraw your consent to these emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email, by adjusting your communication preferences in your account (if available) or by contacting us (see section 8 'Your rights' below).</p><br>
                    <span>(D) For static research</span>
                    <p>i. General: We research general trends in the use of our services, loyalty programs, websites, mobile apps and social media and in the behavior and preferences of our customers, participants in our loyalty programs and users. We use the research results to develop better services and offers for our customers, improve loyalty programs, sharpen our customer service and improve the design and content of our websites and mobile apps.
                        ii. Categories of data: For our research, we may use the categories of personal data described in paragraphs 2.1 (A) to (I) and the personal data that we register when you participate in Flying CRUD (for more information, see the Flying CRUD privacy policy). For the research we only use 'aggregated' and 'pseudonymised' data. This is data that cannot be directly traced back to you and from which all directly identifiable elements (such as name and e-mail address) have been removed or recoded into a number. We take appropriate measures to ensure that only a limited group of employees have access to the dataset.
                        iii. Example: For example, our research on booking data and data on the purchase of additional services (extra baggage, upgrades) may show that long-haul travelers are more likely to purchase extra legroom. With this information we can improve our services, for example by drawing extra attention to the possibility of extra legroom on long-haul flights.
                        iv. Legal basis and right to object: we process your personal data in the context of the legitimate interests described above (see paragraph (i) “General”). You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for statistical research on grounds relating to your particular situation (see section 8 “Your rights” below).
                    </p><br>
                    <span>(E) Marketing Purposes</span>
                    <p>i. General: we may use your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In this section we explain how we do that.</p><br>
                    <p>ii. Channels: we use various channels such as e-mail, mobile push messages, regular mail and advertising space on websites and social media. For example:</p><br>
                    <p>– Booking-related emails: When you book a flight with us, you will receive various emails related to your booking (such as booking confirmation, check-in and boarding information). These emails also contain advertisements and offers tailored to you and your flight.</p><br>
                    <p>– CRUDAirlines Updates and Offers Emails: You can sign up to receive updates and offers tailored to your interests, such as our newsletter. These emails contain offers for our own services and those of our partners, such as the package deals and flight bundles of our partners Airtrade and OptionTown. With your consent, we will also send you emails on specific occasions, such as a special offer on your birthday or personalized offers for your next trip within a few months of your return.</p><br>
                    <p>– Direct messages through other communication channels: With your permission, we use other communication channels to send you messages directly with personalized advertisements and special offers, such as by post, mobile push notifications or via social media (such as Messenger, WhatsApp or WeChat).</p><br>
                    <p>– Showing relevant information and personalized advertisements on websites and apps: see our cookie policy. We may also use your personal data to exclude you from advertisements that are no longer relevant to you.</p><br>
                    <p>– Targeted marketing via social media platforms ("custom audience targeting"): you can sign up to receive personalized advertisements and offers via the social media platforms you use. </p><br>
                    <p>For example, we use the Facebook Custom Audience program. With this program we can, among other things, show personalized advertisements and offers in your news overview on Facebook platforms, such as Facebook Messenger and Instagram. This program also allows us to exclude you from advertising campaigns on the Facebook platforms, for example if you have already received similar advertisements or offers via email.</p><br>
                    <p>We provide your pseudonymised ("hashed") email address to Facebook so that Facebook can verify that you have a Facebook account. Furthermore, we do not provide any other data to Facebook. Conversely, Facebook only provides us with aggregated data about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. This data cannot be traced directly to you. In this way, we do our best to keep your personal data confidential and secure.</p><br>
                    <p>To determine our audience ("audience") for a specific Facebook campaign, we may use your booking information or the information we register when you use our websites, mobile apps or other digital media. In addition, Facebook may use the personal data that Facebook has recorded about you to select a similar audience. This allows us to reach a new audience via Facebook.</p><br>
                    <p>We may participate in similar programs from other social media networks, such as Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, WeChat, Kakaotalk and LINE. For more information, please refer to the privacy policy of the relevant social media network.</p><br>
                    <p>iii. Personalized offers: we try to make advertisements and offers as relevant as possible to you. For this purpose, we may perform analyzes on the categories of personal data described in paragraphs 2.1 (A) to (I) and 4.1 (C) (statistical research) and the personal data that we register when you participate in Flying CRUD (for more information, see information the Flying CRUD privacy policy). We use the analysis results to personalize advertisements and offers. For example, when you return home after a trip, with your permission we can send you an email with offers based on your booking history, which you can use to get inspiration for your next trip. We may also use your booking history (business or private travel, class of travel, destination, member Flying CRUD) to give you a discount on an upgrade or extra baggage.</p><br>
                    <p>iv. Legal basis and right to object: unless otherwise stated, we process your personal data as described in this Section 4.1(E) for our legitimate interests and for the interests of third parties. You have the right to object at any time to the use of your personal data for direct marketing and related profiling activities (see section 8 “Your rights” below).</p><br>
                    <p>v. Unsubscribe: You can always unsubscribe from personalized ads and offers. Below is an explanation of how to unsubscribe.</p><br>
                    <p>– By email: you can unsubscribe at any time from advertisements and offers in our emails regarding your booking and our loyalty programs and from emails you have signed up for by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email . In many cases, you can also unsubscribe by adjusting your communication preferences in your account. If you unsubscribe, you will only receive emails that are necessary to use our services (such as your booking confirmation and e-ticket) and to participate in our loyalty program (such as a welcome message to participants).</p><br>
                    <p>– By post: you can opt out of personalized advertising and special offers by contacting us by post (see section 8 “Your rights” below).</p><br>
                    <p>– Via other communication channels: If you have subscribed to personalized advertisements and offers via mobile push notifications, you can unsubscribe by adjusting the settings on your smartphone (for mobile push notifications). For more information about opting out of personalized ads and offers via social media (such as Messenger, WhatsApp, and WeChat), please visit your social network provider's website.</p><br>
                    <p>– By contacting our Privacy Offices: You can always unsubscribe from communications with advertisements and offers by contacting us (see section 8 'Your rights' below).</p><br>
                    <span>(F) To communicate with you</span><br>
                    <p>We use your contact details to communicate with you about our services or the loyalty program, to answer your questions or to handle your complaints.</p><br>
                    <span>(G) Passengers causing nuisance</span>
                    <p>i. Passengers on the ground or on board who cause nuisance or abuse our services can be banned from our flights for up to five years, or are only allowed on board under certain conditions. CRUDAirlines maintains a list of passengers who have caused nuisance (see 2.1 (J) above). The passengers on this list will be personally informed (if possible in writing) about the fact that they have been placed on this list, why this is the case, what measures CRUDAirlines has taken towards them and how long these special security measures will apply to them. More information about access to or correction of this data can be found below in paragraph 8 'Your rights'.</p><br>
                    <p>ii. Illegal drugs: CRUDAirlines receives from the State of the Netherlands the names of passengers who disembarked at Schiphol and in whom illegal drugs were found by the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee. CRUDAirlines can refuse to transport these persons for a period of 3 years on direct flights from Schiphol to Suriname, Aruba, Bonaire, St. Maarten or Curaçao and on direct flights from these countries to Schiphol. You can request access to or correction of this data by submitting a written request to this effect to the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, PO Box 90615, 2509 LP The Hague. If you reside in Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles, Suriname or Venezuela, you must enclose a copy of your passport with this written request.</p><br>

                    <p>We collect, use and store your personal data for our business operations, such as our administration, for fraud prevention and control or for dispute resolution. In the event of fraud or abuse of our services, we may include your personal data in our internal fraud control and warning systems. As a result, we may scrutinize your bookings and in some cases refuse or cancel them. Or we may decide that you are no longer welcome on board or only under certain conditions (see 4.1(G) above). We also process your personal data for compliance with our legal and tax obligations.</p><br>
                    <h2>4.2 Specific services, apps, events, contests or promotions</h2><br>
                    <p>For specific services, apps, events, contests or promotions, we may use different types of data than described in this privacy policy. We will inform you about this when you register for the service, event, contest or promotion or when you download the app.</p><br>
                    <h2>4.3 Legal basis</h2><br>
                    <p>We can only process your personal data if we have a legal basis to do so. In many cases, we need your personal data to receive and process your booking, arrange your flight or purchases, enable your participation in our loyalty programs or answer your questions (see 4.1 (A) to ( B) and (F) above). We then process your data on the legal basis 'necessary for the execution of an agreement'.</p><br>
                    <p>If you have given your consent to the processing of your personal data (which consent you can withdraw at any time, see section 8 'Your rights' below), we will process your data on the basis of that consent.</p><br>
                    <p>In certain cases, we may use your personal data if we or third parties have a legitimate interest in doing so. We always carefully consider all interests: your interests, those of others and those of CRUDAirlines. On the latter basis, for example, we process your data for security purposes, statistical research, direct marketing or personalized discounts and offers (see 4.1 (C), (D) and (G) above for more information).</p><br>
                    <p>We may have a legal obligation to process your data, for example to comply with immigration formalities (see 4.1(H)).</p><br>
                    <p>If you refuse to provide the personal data that we need for the performance of the agreement we have concluded with you or for compliance with a legal obligation, we may not be able to provide all the services you have requested. In that case, for example, we have to cancel your booking or we cannot provide the additional services you require. If you provide incomplete or incorrect information, we may be forced to deny you boarding your flight or entry into foreign territory.</p><br>

                    <h2>5.1. General</h2>
                    <p>We may provide your personal data to third parties in the following cases:</p><br>
                    <span>(A) To facilitate your bookings and travel</span>
                    <p>In many cases, in order to handle your reservations and bookings and to facilitate your travel and purchases, we need to exchange your personal data with our partner airlines, airport operators and other companies involved in your travel (see 3.1 (B) above, 'How we collect your data").</p><br>
                    <span>(B) For the benefit of our CRUDbiz zakelijke corporate loyalty program</span>
                    <p>For more information, see the “Who we are” section and 3.1 (C) under “How we collect your information”.</p><br>
                    <span>(C) Business Accounts</span>
                    <p>If you book a flight through your employer's business account, your employer has access to certain booking information, such as the ticket price, travel dates and your destination. Your employer is independently responsible for the way in which he processes your personal data and informs you about this.</p><br>
                    <span>(D) For ancillary or additional services</span>
                    <p>To provide our services, we use support or additional services from third parties, such as IT suppliers, social media providers, and marketing and screening agencies. All these third parties are obliged to adequately protect your personal data and to only process it in accordance with our instructions.</p><br>
                    <p>Within the Air CRUD-CRUDAirlines Group, centralized databases and systems are used for business operations. These central databases and systems can be hosted or managed by one of the group companies for the other group companies. In addition, certain operational functions may be performed for efficiency by one of the group companies for the other group companies. This means that our group companies may have access to your personal data in that context. Our group companies may only process your personal data when necessary for the relevant business function and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p><br>
                    <span>(E) Payment Services</span>
                    <p>To process payment for your travel and purchases, we may work with third parties that provide payment services. In many cases, these providers also check for fraud. They have their own privacy policy regarding the way in which they use your personal data.</p><br>
                    <span>(F) Personalized marketing through social media platforms</span>
                    <p>For more information, see section 4.1 (E) under 'The purposes for which we use your data'.</p><br>
                    <span>(G) So that our partners can tailor their offer to your trip</span><br>
                    <p>We may exchange your non-personal information (destination, travel date and travel duration) with partners who offer additional services (such as hotel stays, car rental) so that they can tailor their offer to your trip. They have their own privacy policy regarding the way in which they use your personal data.</p><br>
                    <h2>5.2. Specific services, apps, events, contests or promotions</h2><br>
                    <p>For specific services, apps, events, contests or promotions, we may exchange your data with third parties other than those described in this privacy policy. For example, if we organize a promotion or event together with a partner or if we integrate their services into our apps. We will inform you about this when you register for the service, event, contest or promotion or when you download the app.</p><br>
                    <h2>5.3. Government agencies</h2><br>
                    <span>(A) General</span>
                    <p>We may be required by law to collect your personal information before traveling to another country and provide this information to the government authorities in the countries of your itinerary. For example, we may be legally obliged to pass on your identity data and your booking and travel data to these government authorities for the purposes of border controls, immigration formalities, entering the territory of the relevant country or combating terrorism and other serious crimes (see 5.3 ( B) below). We may also be required by law to disclose your health information to the government authorities in the countries of your itinerary for public health reasons (see 2.1(D) above).</p><br>
                    <span>(B) PNR and API data</span>
                    <p>i. General: Pursuant to European Regulations 2016/679 and 2004/82 and applicable local laws and regulations, we are required to transfer PNR and API data to government bodies, such as the Passenger Information Units (PIUs) in various countries. API (Advance Passenger Information) concerns information about your flight and your passport details. PNR (Passenger Name Record) concerns all information about your bookings, such as flight details, passengers in the booking and payment details. We pass on this PNR data for all flights to the Dutch PIU (Pi-NL). If this is required, we also pass on the API and PNR data to the authorities in countries outside the Netherlands.</p><br>
                    <p>ii. Country specific:</p><br>
                    <p>- France: Pursuant to Article L 237 -7 of the French Internal Security Act, CRUDAirlines may be required to transmit your reservation, check-in and boarding data (API/PNR) to the competent national authorities in France for the purposes and under the conditions as described in Decree No. 2014-1095 of September 26, 2014, as subsequently amended by Decree No. 2018/714 of August 3, 2018.</p><br>

                <button class="accordion">6. Safety</button>
                <div class="panel"><br>
                    <h2>6.1. Safety</h2>
                    <span>(A) Our commitment</span>
                    <p>Ensuring the security and confidentiality of your personal data is our priority. Taking into account the nature of your personal data and the risks of processing, we have taken all appropriate technical and organizational measures required by the applicable legal regulations (in particular Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) so that a appropriate level of security is ensured and in particular to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or disclosure of, infringement of or unauthorized access to this data.</p><br>
                    <span>(B) The security measures we have taken</span>
                    <p>i. Banking Transactions: We are required to comply with the Data Security Standard for the Payment Card Industry (the PCI DSS standard) of the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). This standard has been developed to gain more control over cardholder data and to tackle fraud with payment instruments. All CRUDAirlines service providers that process bank card data must comply with this PCI DSS standard. We want to prevent identity theft on the internet as much as possible. For this reason, for example, we use equipment to detect fraudulent payments, so that you are protected in the event of loss or theft of your bank card.</p><br>
                    <p>ii. Organizational measures: we have taken various organizational measures to increase the alertness of our employees and for accountability. Programs have been introduced that raise awareness while promoting the exchange of good practices and safety standards. In that context, our employees have access to a wide range of documents about information security and privacy protection and everything that comes with it.</p><br>
                    <p>iii. Technical measures: we strictly monitor physical and logical access to the internal servers on which your personal data is hosted or processed. We secure our network with the latest hardware (Firewall, IDS, DLP, etc.) and architecture (including security protocols such as TLS 1.2) to prevent and mitigate the risks of cybercrime.</p><br>
                    <span>(C) Developing our security systems</span>
                    <p>In order to maintain an appropriate level of security, we have internal processes according to the best standards (especially the ISO 27000 standards). We use skilled professionals to guarantee the highest possible level of protection. In that context, we maintain a special relationship with the NCSC (National Cyber ​​Security Centre).</p><br>
                    <span>(D) What you can do yourself</span>
                    <p>When it comes to the security and confidentiality of personal data, it is all about the optimal use of all those involved. When you make a reservation, you will receive file references. These booking references must remain confidential at all times. If these references reach other passengers, they may access your booking details through our systems or those of third parties involved in executing your trip (such as travel agents and online search and booking sites). If you are traveling together and do not want your travel companions to have access to your personal data, we recommend that you book separately.</p><br>
                    <p>We also advise you not to provide the passwords you use for our services to third parties, to systematically log out of your profile and social account (especially with linked accounts) and to close the browser screen after your session, with especially if you are accessing the Internet from a public computer. This prevents other users from viewing your personal data. To avoid the risk of hacking, we recommend that you use a different password for each online service you use. We are not responsible for the theft of your data on a platform that is not controlled by us.</p><br>
                    <p>In addition, we strongly advise you not to provide documents provided by CRUDAirlines in which your personal data (your boarding pass, ticket number, etc.) or other information about your trip are included to third parties, nor to publish them on a social network. If you do post these documents on social media, you should be familiar with the general terms of use, information security and privacy policies of the relevant network providers. We are not responsible for the way in which your data is processed, stored or transferred on such a platform.</p><br>
                    <span>(E) Security Incident Control</span>
                    <p>There is no 'zero risk' and even if we take all appropriate security measures, unforeseen things can still happen. We have specific procedures and resources in place to best manage security incidents. In addition, we have a specific procedure for assessing potential data breaches that could result in accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure of or access to your personal data, for timely reporting data breaches to the competent supervisory authority and to you if we believe that the data breach poses a high risk to your rights and freedoms. We periodically test whether the safety installations function and whether the procedures and equipment used are adequate.</p><br>
                    <h2>6.2. Storage</h2>
                    <p>We do not store your personal data for longer than is necessary. How long your personal data is stored depends on the purposes for which this data is processed and on the applicable legal retention period.</p><br>

                    <p>7.1. CRUDAirlines may transfer your personal data to countries other than your country of residence. We do this to handle your booking or to arrange your trip or because our group companies, partners or service providers carry out their activities from another country.</p><br>
                    <p>7.2. If you fly to a destination in a country other than where you live, the transfer of your personal data to that country is often necessary in order to provide our services to you. If necessary, CRUDAirlines ensures that appropriate safeguards are in place to comply with the requirements for the international transfer of personal data under the applicable privacy legislation. For the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area, CRUDAirlines may use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission as an appropriate safeguard.</p><br>
                    <p>7.3. We may be required by law to transfer your personal data to government authorities in the countries of your itinerary (see 5.3 above).</p><br>

                <div class="panel"><br>
                    <p>8.1. By contacting our Privacy Office (see 8.4 below) you can exercise all of your rights under applicable privacy law, including (A) accessing your data, (B) rectifying your data, (C) erasure of your data, (D) restrict the processing of your data, (E) the right to data portability and (F) the right to object to processing.</p><br>
                    <span>(A) Right of access</span>
                    <p>You may ask us whether we process your personal data. If that is the case, you can inspect this data in the form of a copy.</p><br>
                    <span>(B) Recht op rectificatie</span>
                    <p>You have the right to rectify your data if it is incorrect or incomplete. Upon request, we will correct incorrect personal data and complete incomplete personal data, taking into account the processing purposes; this may include issuing an additional statement.</p><br>
                    <span>(C) Right to erasure</span>
                    <p>You have the right to have your personal data deleted. This means that we will then delete your data. The erasure of your personal data only takes place in certain cases, which are prescribed by law and listed in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example when your personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were originally processed or when they have been processed unlawfully. Due to the way in which we have set up certain services, it can take some time before backups are deleted.</p><br>
                    <span>(D) Right to restriction of processing</span>
                    <p>You have the right to have the processing of your personal data restricted. This means that we suspend the processing of your data for a certain period of time. Circumstances that may give rise to this include situations in which the correctness of your personal data is contested, but we need some time to verify its (in)accuracy. This right does not mean that we cannot continue to store your personal data. We will let you know when the restriction is lifted.</p><br>
                    <span>(E) Right to data portability</span>
                    <p>Your right to data portability means that you may ask us to obtain your personal data, where technically possible, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form and to transfer it to another controller. Upon request and if this is technically possible, your personal data will then be transferred by us directly to the other controller.</p>
                    <span>(F) Right to object</span>
                    <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data. This means that you can ask us to stop processing your personal data. This only applies if "legitimate interests" (including profiling) are the legal basis for the processing (see 4.3 "Legal basis" above). You can object to direct marketing at any time free of charge when your personal data is processed for this purpose. This also includes profiling in connection with direct marketing. If you exercise this right, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes.</p><br>
                    <h2>8.2. Withdrawal of your consent</h2>
                    <p>You can withdraw your consent at any time by following the specific instructions related to the processing for which you have consented. For example, you can withdraw your consent by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email, by adjusting your communication preferences in your account (if available) or by changing your smartphone settings (for mobile push notifications and location data)</p><br>
                    <p>You can also contact the CRUDAirlines Privacy Office. For CRUDbiz emails you can also contact the Air CRUD Privacy Office.</p><br>
                    <h2>8.3. Refusal or limitation of rights</h2>
                    <p>There may be situations where we may deny or limit your rights described in 8.2 above. We carefully assess on a case-by-case basis whether such an exception exists. You will be notified of this. For example, we can refuse your request for access when this is necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others, or we can refuse to delete your personal data if the processing of this data is necessary to comply with legal obligations. For example, the right to data portability does not apply if the personal data has not been provided by you or if we do not process the data on the basis of your consent or for the execution of an agreement.</p><br>
